# GDO Laboratory

This directory contains rough drafts and half-baked ideas, many of
which are pseudocode, most of which are wrong.  Nothing here is
supposed to make sense or be useful for anything whatsoever.  A very
small subset may graduate from here to elsewhere in the repository.

## To Do

- replace deque with something faster and retry
  ./hashing_speed_test.py
- turn the stream hash in cdh1 into a root hash of the hash list;
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_list
- merge rough_draft_pseudocode.py with db_sqlite
-  create a vanilla DB superclass for future storage methods
- finish put.py
- finish get.py
- finish db_sqlite.py
- cdch as higher-performance version of cdc1+cdh1 
- reimplement cdc1p in C
