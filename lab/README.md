# GDO Laboratory

This directory contains rough drafts and half-baked ideas, many of
which are pseudocode, most of which are wrong.  Nothing here is
supposed to make sense or be useful for anything whatsoever.  A very
small subset may graduate from here to elsewhere in the repository.

## To Do

- remove single-byte restriction on cdc1 src (use ring buffer)
- cdh1
- merge rough_draft_pseudocode.py with db_sqlite
-  create a vanilla DB superclass for future storage methods
- finish put.py
- finish get.py
- finish db_sqlite.py
- cdch as higher-performance version of cdc1+cdh1
