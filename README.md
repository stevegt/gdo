Governance of Distributed Organizations

Not a whole lot here yet -- throwing this together quickly for the [Aug 2016
Nation of Makers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/nation-of-makers) session.  Bullds
on upmteen years of earlier work and prototyping at
github.com/stevegt/librabinpoly and github.com/stevegt/git-devops.  Shares a
few concepts with HyperLedger, Ethereum, Ledger-cli, git, and git-annex.
Distant relative of github.com/stevegt/ISconf.

We'd like to target more of a git-like version control model, allowing forking
and interbranch consensus, rather than a single linear blockchain.  For smart
contracts, we simply use Linux containers rather than design a language.

Question for the intertubes:  If forks are allowed and there can be multiple
roots as well as multiple heads, then is this a "blockmesh" instead of a
blockchain?
