          Not a whole lot here yet -- throwing this site together
          quickly for discussions at the August 2016 White House
          Office of Science and Technology Policy meeting of
          makerspace organizers.  As of this writing I'm scraping
          together code from various directories on my hard drive,
          most of which will land in the <a
          href="https://github.com/stevegt/gdo/tree/master/lab">lab
      directory</a> first.  If you are interested in either developing
  or being a guinea pig for this project, then either interact with
  the github project in some way, or ping me @stevegt on twitter.  If
  you are one of the meeting delegates, you should also be able to reach me
  via facebook or slack.

<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>A distributed-ledger system suitable for hosting smart contracts and
running on IoT devices.  A few example applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Organizational governance</li>
<li>Workflow</li>
<li>Training and certification</li>
<li>Accounting</li>
<li>Inventory control</li>
<li>Door access control</li>
<li>Machine lockout</li>
<li>Membership</li>
<li>Reservations</li>
<li>Data storage and backups</li>
<li>Operating system and disk image management</li>
<li>IoT </li>
</ul>

<p>We accomplish all this using a (relatively) simple model:  Distributed
applications (dapps) running in Linux containers managed by a
distributed ledger, hosted in a distributed version control system
that performs content-defined chunking to store and ship around large
blobs, including the container images themselves.</p>

<p>The development roadmap, then, is (relatively) straightforward:
Implement things in reverse order of the above paragraph.  Beg,
borrow, and paste where possible, take advantage of existing code and
libraries such as libcontainer, ledger-cli, and libgit2, and become
self-hosting early.</p>

<p>Compared to e.g. Ethereum or HyperLedger, we target more of
a git-like version control model, allowing forking and interbranch
consensus, rather than a single linear blockchain.  For
turing-complete smart contracts, we simply use Linux containers --
this allows dapps to be written in any language executable on Linux.</p>

<p>We'll use test-driven consensus (proof of merge), where new blocks are
tested by one or more dapps, rather than use a hardcoded proof-of-work
algorithm.  Not requiring a compute-intensive proof of work means
single-board computers such as BeagleBone or Raspberry Pi can host
full nodes.</p>

<h2>
<a id="example" class="anchor" href="#example" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example</h2>

<p>Maker space door access control, for instance, could be based on an
existing open source project such as
<a href="https://github.com/makeitlabs/doorbot">https://github.com/makeitlabs/doorbot</a>, living in a container, with
modifications to have it communicate with membership, accounting, and
certification dapps, each in their own containers.  Comms are via the
blockchain, and all of this runs on localhost, as opposed to talking
to a central SQL db on a server somewhere else.  Each door can have
its own Raspberry Pi-sized host.  These will check and log access
events as usual even during network outages, and the blockchain's
distributed consensus protocol will merge records when the network
comes back up.</p>

<h2>
<a id="references" class="anchor" href="#references" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>References</h2>

<p>Shares a few concepts with HyperLedger, Ethereum, Docker, Ledger-cli,
git, and git-annex.  Builds on earlier work and prototyping at
github.com/stevegt/librabinpoly and github.com/stevegt/git-devops.</p>

<h2>
<a id="open-questions" class="anchor" href="#open-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>If forks are allowed (depending on dapp) and there can be multiple
roots as well as multiple heads, then is this a "blockmesh" instead
of a blockchain?</li>
</ul>
