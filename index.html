          <p>
          I originally threw this site together 
          for discussions with 
            <a href=https://makezine.com/2016/08/31/makerspace-organizers-convene-at-the-white-house/>
            a couple hundred close friends
          </a>
            at the White House in August of 2016 -- that meeting led to a joint effort to move the
          <a href=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/nation-of-makers>Nation of Makers</a> functions
            out of the executive branch and into <a href=https://nationofmakers.us/>an independent non-profit</a>
            three months later. For now I seem to have become the unofficial and defacto "RFC
            editor" for this new organization -- more on that in a moment.
          <p>
            I've always thought that, for better or for worse, systems and organizations shape each other. A federated
            system supports a community and tends to be described in terms of format, algorithm, and protocol. Anyone
            can participate in development, and resources are mutually shared; no single person can veto an experiment
            in innovation or growth.  This is a powerful idea.  Contrast this with a centralized system, which today tends
            to be described in terms of a URL, a server, and the single organization that owns it. In a centralized system,
            the owning organization must ultimately make all decisions and pay all the bills. Sole ownership creates an
            unavoidable time and funding bottleneck, stifling independent innovation and growth.
            We see these limitations play out over and over again in large enterprises, and most
            startups, whether for-profit or not, fail due to these natural limits on execution. Conversely, those startups
            that do succeed tend to be those that rely heavily on network effects.
          <p>
            The Internet's early developers stumbled into a system and organizational design where anyone can contribute,
            where decisions are made by rough consensus, and where both innovation and expenses are distributed.  The
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force>Internet Engineering Task Force</a> is
            the organization that loosely steers the development of the Internet, and is
            an unincorporated all-volunteer community with <a href=https://www.ietf.org/newcomers.html>no membership
            list</a>. The IETF uses the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments>RFC</a> process for
            decision-making.  For those things that absolutely must be centralized, such as renting conference venues, 
            IETF members formed the non-profit <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Society>ISOC</a>
            to act as their legal and financial representative.
          <p>
            I've spent a few decades trying to figure out how to apply these lessons learned to smaller projects and companies 
            ("smaller" being defined as anything smaller than the Internet). A useful question is:  <b>If we were to start an IETF-like organization today, using current technologies,
            what would it look like?</b>  The answer to this question has been a moving target as long as I've been asking
            it, mostly because of the rapid evolution of technology itself.  But I think two related events form cusps in 
            the target's trajectory:  First, strong cryptography was demilitarized by <a href=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1996-11-19/pdf/96-29692.pdf>
            Executive Order 13026</a>.  The resulting free flow of cryptographic code then enabled practical usability
            of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain>blockchain</a>
            distributed data structure.
          <p>
            Aside from the hype currently surrounding cryptocurrencies, I think it's safe
            to say that, if an IETF-like organization were established today, it would likely use a blockchain to host,
            form consensus around, approve, and act
            as storage of record for RFC-like documents.  Many of the internet protocols IETF created would be different
            as well -- DNS, the entire domain name system, and SSL certificates are all examples of things
            which were designed as centralized systems because we did not yet have cryptographically strong 
            distributed systems to build upon.
          <p>
            Our hypothetical blockchain-based IETF would probably also do much of its computing using
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Ethereum_Virtual_Machine>distributed virtual machines</a>.  I believe 
            many algorithms could be implemented as "serverless" <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>lambda</a> functions 
            hosted on a blockchain.
          <p>
            Last but not least, the IETF is already a rudimentary 
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization>decentralized autonomous organization</a>,
            held together by the RFCs as well as <a href=https://www.ietf.org/tao.html>customs and courtesies</a> that are generally-accepted
            by the community.  If re-implemented today, much of this workflow would likely be implemented as 
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract>smart contracts</a>.  As of today we may not know how to 
            overcome the security concerns that exist in complex persistent contracts; a lot of people are working 
            on this though.  I have some ideas myself, and plan to describe some of them here.
          <p>
            The chicken-scratchings in this git repository are my own feeble attempts to answer these "what if"
            questions
            for my own businesses, as well as for the other organizations I am involved with and may be able to
            foist this stuff upon.
            The original repo contents came from me scraping
            together code from various directories on my hard drive, putting most of
            it in the <a href="https://github.com/stevegt/gdo/tree/master/lab">lab directory</a> for now. 
            If you are interested in either helping to develop 
            or in being a guinea pig for this project, then interact with
            the github project in some way, or ping me @stevegt on twitter.  If
            you are one of the NoM folks, you should also be able to reach me
            via slack.

<h2>
<a id="roadmap" class="anchor" href="#roadmap" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Roadmap</h2>

<p>A distributed-ledger system suitable for hosting smart contracts and
running on IoT devices.  A few example applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Organizational governance</li>
<li>Workflow</li>
<li>Training and certification</li>
<li>Accounting</li>
<li>Inventory control</li>
<li>Door access control</li>
<li>Machine lockout</li>
<li>Membership</li>
<li>Reservations</li>
<li>Data storage and backups</li>
<li>Operating system and disk image management</li>
<li>IoT </li>
</ul>

<p>We accomplish all this using a (relatively) simple model:  Distributed
applications (dapps) running in Linux containers managed by a
distributed ledger, hosted in a distributed version control system
that performs content-defined chunking to store and ship around large
blobs, including the container images themselves.</p>

<p>The development roadmap, then, is (relatively) straightforward:
Implement things in reverse order of the above paragraph.  Beg,
borrow, and paste where possible, take advantage of existing code and
libraries such as libcontainer, ledger-cli, and libgit2, and become
self-hosting early.</p>

<p>Compared to e.g. Ethereum or HyperLedger, we target more of
a git-like version control model, allowing forking and interbranch
consensus, rather than a single linear blockchain.  For
turing-complete smart contracts, we simply use Linux containers --
this allows dapps to be written in any language executable on Linux.</p>

<p>We'll use test-driven consensus (proof of merge), where new blocks are
tested by one or more dapps, rather than use a hardcoded proof-of-work
algorithm.  Not requiring a compute-intensive proof of work means
single-board computers such as BeagleBone or Raspberry Pi can host
full nodes.</p>

<h2>
<a id="example" class="anchor" href="#example" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example</h2>

<p>Maker space door access control, for instance, could be based on an
existing open source project such as
<a href="https://github.com/makeitlabs/doorbot">https://github.com/makeitlabs/doorbot</a>, living in a container, with
modifications to have it communicate with membership, accounting, and
certification dapps, each in their own containers.  Comms are via the
blockchain, and all of this runs on localhost, as opposed to talking
to a central SQL db on a server somewhere else.  Each door can have
its own Raspberry Pi-sized host.  These will check and log access
events as usual even during network outages, and the blockchain's
distributed consensus protocol will merge records when the network
comes back up.</p>

<h2>
<a id="references" class="anchor" href="#references" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>References</h2>

<p>Shares a few concepts with HyperLedger, Ethereum, Docker, Ledger-cli,
git, and git-annex.  Builds on earlier work and prototyping at
github.com/stevegt/librabinpoly and github.com/stevegt/git-devops.</p>

<h2>
<a id="open-questions" class="anchor" href="#open-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>If forks are allowed (depending on dapp) and there can be multiple
roots as well as multiple heads, then is this a "blockmesh" instead
of a blockchain?</li>
</ul>
