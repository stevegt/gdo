          I originally threw this site together 
          for discussions with 
            <a href=https://makezine.com/2016/08/31/makerspace-organizers-convene-at-the-white-house/>
            a couple hundred close friends
          </a>
            at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy meeting of
          makerspace organizers in August of 2016 -- that meeting led to a joint effort to move the
          <a href=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/nation-of-makers>Nation of Makers</a> functions
            out of the Executive Branch and into <a href=https://nationofmakers.us/>an independent non-profit</a>
            three months later. For now I seem to have become the unofficial and defacto "RFC
            editor" for this new organization -- more on that in a moment.
          <p>
            I've always thought that, for better or for worse, systems shape the organizations that use them. 
            If you want to have a federated community made of up
            multiple people and organizations, you need a federated system to support that.  If you instead set up a
            centralized system to support multiple entities, the single organization operating that system needs to make
            the decisions and pay the bills regarding that system, and can't avoid having an outsized influence. This
            creates bandwidth and funding problems, stifling both creativity and growth.
          <p>
            The Internet's early developers stumbled into a model where anyone can contribute,
            where decisions are made by rough consensus, and where both innovation and expenses are distributed.  The 
            Internet is loosely managed by the 
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force>IETF</a>, an unincorporated all-volunteer
            organization with <a href=https://www.ietf.org/newcomers.html>no membership list</a>.
            The IETF uses the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments>RFC</a> process for
            decision-making, and for those things that absolutely have to be centralized, such as renting conference venues, 
            IETF members formed the non-profit <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Society>ISOC</a>
            to act as their legal and financial representative.
          <p>
            I've spent a few decades trying to figure out how to apply these lessons learned to smaller projects and companies 
            ("smaller" being defined as anything smaller than the Internet). A useful question is:  <b>If we were to start an IETF-like organization today, using current technologies,
            what would it look like?</b>  The answer to this question has been a moving target as long as I've been asking
            it, mostly because of the rapid evolution of technology itself.  But I think two related events form cusps in 
            the target's trajectory:  The demilitarization of cryptography by <a href=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1996-11-19/pdf/96-29692.pdf>
            Executive Order 13026</a>, which enabled strong cryptography and practical use of the 
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain>blockchain</a>
            distributed data structure.
          <p>
            In spite of the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies, I think it's safe
            to say that, if an IETF-like organization was established today, it would use a blockchain to edit, approve, and act
            as storage of record for RFC-like documents.  Many of the internet protocols IETF created would be different as 
            well -- DNS, the entire domain name system, and SSL certificates are all examples of things
            which were designed as centralized systems because we did not yet have cryptographically strong blockchains to build
            upon.
          <p>
            Our hypothetical blockchain-based IETF would probably also do much of its computing using
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Ethereum_Virtual_Machine>distributed virtual machines</a>.  I believe 
            much of this code would be implemented as "serverless" <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>lambda</a> functions 
            hosted on a blockchain.
          <p>
            Last but not least, the IETF is already a rudimentary 
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization>decentralized autonomous organization</a>,
            held together by the RFCs as well as <a href=https://www.ietf.org/tao.html>customs and courtesies</a> that are generally-accepted
            by the community.  If re-implemented today, much of this workflow would likely be implemented as 
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract>smart contracts</a>.
          <p>
            The chicken-scratchings in this git repository, then, are my own feeble attempts to answer these "what if"
            questions,
            for my own businesses as well as the other organizations I am involved with and may be able to foist this stuff upon.
            The original contents of this git repository came from me scraping
            together code from various directories on my hard drive, putting most of
            it in the <a href="https://github.com/stevegt/gdo/tree/master/lab">lab directory</a>. 
            If you are interested in either helping to develop 
            or in being a guinea pig for this project, then interact with
            the github project in some way, or ping me @stevegt on twitter.  If
            you are one of the NoM folks, you should also be able to reach me
            via slack.

<h2>
<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>A distributed-ledger system suitable for hosting smart contracts and
running on IoT devices.  A few example applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Organizational governance</li>
<li>Workflow</li>
<li>Training and certification</li>
<li>Accounting</li>
<li>Inventory control</li>
<li>Door access control</li>
<li>Machine lockout</li>
<li>Membership</li>
<li>Reservations</li>
<li>Data storage and backups</li>
<li>Operating system and disk image management</li>
<li>IoT </li>
</ul>

<p>We accomplish all this using a (relatively) simple model:  Distributed
applications (dapps) running in Linux containers managed by a
distributed ledger, hosted in a distributed version control system
that performs content-defined chunking to store and ship around large
blobs, including the container images themselves.</p>

<p>The development roadmap, then, is (relatively) straightforward:
Implement things in reverse order of the above paragraph.  Beg,
borrow, and paste where possible, take advantage of existing code and
libraries such as libcontainer, ledger-cli, and libgit2, and become
self-hosting early.</p>

<p>Compared to e.g. Ethereum or HyperLedger, we target more of
a git-like version control model, allowing forking and interbranch
consensus, rather than a single linear blockchain.  For
turing-complete smart contracts, we simply use Linux containers --
this allows dapps to be written in any language executable on Linux.</p>

<p>We'll use test-driven consensus (proof of merge), where new blocks are
tested by one or more dapps, rather than use a hardcoded proof-of-work
algorithm.  Not requiring a compute-intensive proof of work means
single-board computers such as BeagleBone or Raspberry Pi can host
full nodes.</p>

<h2>
<a id="example" class="anchor" href="#example" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example</h2>

<p>Maker space door access control, for instance, could be based on an
existing open source project such as
<a href="https://github.com/makeitlabs/doorbot">https://github.com/makeitlabs/doorbot</a>, living in a container, with
modifications to have it communicate with membership, accounting, and
certification dapps, each in their own containers.  Comms are via the
blockchain, and all of this runs on localhost, as opposed to talking
to a central SQL db on a server somewhere else.  Each door can have
its own Raspberry Pi-sized host.  These will check and log access
events as usual even during network outages, and the blockchain's
distributed consensus protocol will merge records when the network
comes back up.</p>

<h2>
<a id="references" class="anchor" href="#references" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>References</h2>

<p>Shares a few concepts with HyperLedger, Ethereum, Docker, Ledger-cli,
git, and git-annex.  Builds on earlier work and prototyping at
github.com/stevegt/librabinpoly and github.com/stevegt/git-devops.</p>

<h2>
<a id="open-questions" class="anchor" href="#open-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>If forks are allowed (depending on dapp) and there can be multiple
roots as well as multiple heads, then is this a "blockmesh" instead
of a blockchain?</li>
</ul>
